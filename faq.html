										<h1>FAQ</h1>

									<p>Are you compelled by our cause, but afraid to speak out, or skeptical of our approach? Let us clear up some misconceptions.</p>

									<h2>Why don’t we just meet with administrators and negotiate in good faith, and have an honest discussion about this?</h2>
									<p>While SUNY Guidelines require departments that charge “Broad Based Fees” to meet with student governments in the process of proposing any increases, approval is not required for proposals to be sent to the SUNY Board of Trustees. During the meetings in Spring 2020 prior to the COVID-19 Pandemic with the Graduate Student Organization, it became obvious that administration officials were presenting their proposals with no intention of any revisions. Furthermore, during the April Senate Meeting where administration officials met with Graduate students, officials admitted that because they expect a financial burden as a result of the COVID pandemic, there would be no adjustments to proposals for fee increases for the sole purpose of generating revenue. Because of this, it is obvious that Stony Brook University officials have no intention of having an honest discussion, in good faith, to negotiate fee increases. </p>

									<h2>How do administrators respond when we communicate how the fees hurt us?</h2>
									<p>When discussing fees, administrators repeatedly claim that fees are collected from graduate students because we are earning a degree, and that this is independent from our stipends. In fact, these are some actual statements from SBU administrators:</p>
									
									<blockquote>“You look at a stipend minus the fees. And what does that actually leave you in a paycheck? I have heard that. I know that we've discussed that before.”</blockquote>

									<blockquote>“I know that you’re employees, but you're also students. I was an employee and a student, and I did pay the fees as a student. And I think that's where the university is drawing the distinction that we're charging students, not as employees.”</blockquote>

									<h2>Will speaking out about freezing the increase in student fees make my PI upset?</h2>
									<p>No [EXPAND]</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Am I fighting against my PI by supporting fee freezes?</h2>
									<p>No [EXPAND]</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>What happens if my PI is not happy I posted something about upper admin?</h2>
									<p>[EXPAND]</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Will the administration retaliate against its students, staff, and faculty? </h2>
									<p>[EXPAND]</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Is there any sort of itemized budget that dictates how fees are spent? </h2>
									<p>With the exception of the Graduate Activity Fee (which is accounted for in the GSO budget), <strong>no</strong>. GSO has asked Rick Gatteau several times for such a thing; he has never been willing to produce one and even claimed such a document doesn’t exist. As far as we can figure, fees are an unregulated slush fund used to shore up gaps in the budget with little bearing to how they are named. Rick more or less said they were raising fees for FY2021 to cover expected state shortfall in the April GSO meeting.</p>

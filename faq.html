										<h1>FAQ</h1>
									</header>

									<p>Are you compelled by our cause, but afraid to speak out, or skeptical of our approach? Let us clear up some misconceptions.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Why don't we just meet with administrators and negotiate in good faith, and have an honest discussion about this?</h2>
									<p>While SUNY Guidelines require departments that charge “Broad Based Fees” to meet with student governments in the process of proposing any increases, approval is not required for proposals to be sent to the SUNY Board of Trustees. During the meetings in Spring 2020 prior to the COVID-19 Pandemic with the Graduate Student Organization, it became obvious that administration officials were presenting their proposals with no intention of any revisions. Furthermore, during the April Senate Meeting where administration officials met with Graduate students, officials admitted that because they expect a financial burden as a result of the COVID pandemic, there would be no adjustments to proposals for fee increases for the sole purpose of generating revenue. Because of this, it is obvious that Stony Brook University officials have no intention of having an honest discussion, in good faith, to negotiate fee increases. </p>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>How do administrators respond when we communicate how the fees hurt us?</h2>
									<p>When discussing fees, administrators repeatedly claim that fees are collected from graduate students because we are earning a degree, and that this is independent from our stipends. In fact, these are some actual statements from SBU administrator Rick Gatteau:</p>
									
									<blockquote>“You look at a stipend minus the fees. And what does that actually leave you in a paycheck? I have heard that. I know that we've discussed that before.”</blockquote>

									<blockquote>“I know that you're employees, but you're also students. I was an employee and a student, and I did pay the fees as a student. And I think that's where the university is drawing the distinction that we're charging students, not as employees.”</blockquote>
									
									<p>What Rick misses here is that it is impossible to charge just the student part of a student employee; you can't split them in half neatly, ignore one half and call it fair. They are one and the same person, with the same bank account and the same employer who pays the same stipend. One cannot be a student employee without also being a student. When being paid depends on paying fees, it doesn't matter how you spin it: <strong>it's wage theft.</strong></p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Will speaking out about freezing the increase in student fees make my PI upset?</h2>
									<p><strong>It shouldn't.</strong> Most PIs are at worst ambivalent to this issue and some are even very supportive. As long as you also get your work done, it shouldn't be an issue.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Am I fighting against my PI by supporting fee freezes?</h2>
									<p>You are <strong>certainly not</strong> fighting against your PI by supporting fee freezes or abolishments. Neither departments nor individual labs are supported by monies collected through fees; they are by and large funded by grants and state support, with the exception of small funding lines available through the GSO. If anything, you are <em>supporting</em> your PI by demanding fees be abolished because the fewer fees graduate students and graduate employees have to pay, the less we have to stress about basic living expenses and the more we can focus on the research and teaching that we are actually here to do.</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>What happens if my PI is not happy I posted something about upper admin?</h2>
									<p><strong>They would in all likelihood just have to live with it.</strong> They would be hard pressed to take disciplinary action against you either as your boss or your academic advisor for being critical of your own university unless they completely fabricated their reasons for doing so. If your PI does try some underhanded stuff, contact either your union rep or the GSO depending on if its work- or academics-related.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Will the administration retaliate against its students, staff, and faculty? </h2>
									<p><strong>They might, but they are limited</strong> in what they can do by their desire to keep up enrollment (and keep revenue coming in), bad publicity over messy actions, and the fact that they only hurt themselves and their reputation when they go after employees, especially teaching staff. Further, they are in the midst of a crisis currently and losing hands only makes it worse for them.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Is there any sort of itemized budget that dictates how fees are spent? </h2>
									<p>With the exception of the Graduate Activity Fee (which is accounted for in the GSO budget), <strong>no</strong>. GSO has asked Rick Gatteau several times for such a thing; he has never been willing to produce one and even claimed such a document doesn't exist. As far as we can figure, fees are an unregulated slush fund used to shore up gaps in the budget with little bearing to how they are named. Rick more or less said they were raising fees for FY2021 to cover expected state shortfall in the April GSO meeting.</p>

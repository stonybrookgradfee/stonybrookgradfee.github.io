										<h1>Open Letter From SBU GSEU on Graduate Student Wages</h1>
									</header>

									<p>What is it like to be a graduate student in Stony Brook University? This is what we tried to find out in our recent survey on financial evaluation, which so far received 266 responses. Our findings portray a dismal, debilitating, and anguished life filled with anxiety and stress resulting from poverty. </p>
									
									<p>The numbers speak for themselves. We asked graduate workers if their stipend is enough to sustain themselves, 85% answered no. We asked them if their stipend is enough to “live comfortably, and to focus on your research, without financial worry and stress,” 99% said no. To the question in which we asked if they have encountered financial problems during their time in Stony Brook, 79% of graduate workers answered yes and 12% answered maybe, leaving only 9% who have not encountered financial problems during their time at Stony Brook. When we asked students if their financial problems impacted their research or teaching, 68% said yes and 18% said maybe, which leaves only 14% whose research and teaching has not been impacted by their finances. Another question we asked was if graduate workers’ mental health has been impacted by financial problems. 71% answered yes, 17% answered maybe, which means only 12% of Stony Brook graduate workers did not have mental health problems resulting from financial causes. Finally, how did Stony Brook graduate workers compare Stony Brook’s base stipend to what they think is a living wage? 99.6% said our base stipend is below living wage, 90% of the respondents to this question said our stipend is “very low” compared to a living wage. </p>
									
									<p>However, as striking as these numbers are, they carry with them a world of stories that express the tragic situations Stony Brook graduate workers live in. In our survey we saw that many graduate students live paycheck to paycheck, leaving us with great anxiety over bills, rent, groceries, and possible emergency expenses that could bankrupt us. This anxiety pushes many graduate workers to get second or third jobs, damaging our research and competence as educators. Graduate students live in unsafe or abusive homes because they cannot afford to move and get apartments by themselves. Some of us cannot afford to see our families, while others cannot afford to start one. We cannot afford a healthy diet, a safe and comfortable accommodation, ability to engage in normal social activities, and to live without mental health problems: in short, we cannot afford to live in a way deserving of a human being.</p>
									
									<p>Trying to survive with stipends below a living wage is hurting us. This hurts our mental health, fueling depression and anxiety for some of us, by making us worry constantly about whether we will be able to afford to live next week, and dreading a simple emergency that will leave us ungrounded. It hurts us by confining us to harmful and abusive living conditions. It hurts us by keeping us from visiting our families and friends, or even having dinner in a “restaurant or a cup of coffee in a cafe with them, because it’d be too expensive”. It hurts our bodies by forcing us to choose unhealthy food because eating healthy means not being able to pay rent. It hurts us when it leaves us to choose between basic car maintenance or groceries, which endangers our lives. It hurts us when it turns our disciplines that we love and come to Stony Brook to dedicate our lives to, into an exploitative reality, a source of financial misery and unhappiness. This is why we acknowledge the problem of living wage as a problem of violence, a structural, slow and long-term violence that hurts us on many levels. </p>
									
									<p>To our fellow graduate workers we say: you are not alone in your problems. The financial and mental health issues you are experiencing are not isolated. You deserve to live a comfortable and happy life where you can follow your passions in research and teaching. Your financial struggles are not your fault and the life that your stipend confines you certainly does not express your value, ability, or merit as a graduate worker or a human being. </p>
									
									<p>We ask our faculty: do you want to see a university where all our programs flourish, where graduate workers produce the best research they can and our students receive the best quality of education possible? Do you want to see all graduate students live a happy and fulfilled life where they can realize their utmost potential? If so, we invite you to support our efforts for a living wage. Anxious, hungry, worried and financially struggling graduate workers do not make good researchers or educators. The advancement of all our programs lie in improving the conditions of graduate workers. </p>
									
									<p>Lastly, we call on to President McInnis: you have professional, moral and personal responsibilities to ensure a living wage for graduate workers. </p>
									
									<p>We say professional responsibility because the current conditions of graduate workers betray the mission statement of Stony Brook University. The mission statement of the university includes providing highest quality education and research. We make the necessary repetition: anxious, hungry, worried and financially struggling graduate workers do not make good researchers or educators. Stony Brook mission statement also includes providing a “leadership for economic growth” for “neighboring communities and the wider geographic region.” How can a university that cannot even give a living wage to its workers provide economic leadership to the community? President McInnis, as the president of our university, to fulfill the mission statement of Stony Brook University effectively, we call on you to provide a living wage for graduate workers.</p>
									
									<p>We say moral responsibility, because as the president of our university, you have the power to end human suffering, relieve immense stress, worry and anxiety, and give comfort and happiness to thousands of graduate workers. We call on you to alleviate the issues graduate workers face, only a miniscule part of which we described above. </p>
									
									<p>We say personal responsibility because you have conveyed in different statements and initiatives your care for graduate students’ lives and financial issues. In your announcement of our fee scholarship, you said that you know how critical graduate workers are for the research and teaching in our university. In the announcement of the new Presidential Dissertation Completion & Extension Awards, you said that “[a]t Stony Brook, we value supporting our doctoral students” and emphasized that “[g]iving our doctoral students additional financial and intellectual resources enables them to go further in their studies and break new intellectual ground, and their individual success becomes our success as a university.” We agree with this statement. However, the overwhelming majority of graduate workers think the support they have received from the administration is insufficient. We asked in our survey whether the respondents think the new presidential awards are enough to solve graduate student financial hardship. 97.4% answered no. When we asked graduate workers if they support our living wage campaign 100% answered yes. President McInnis, if you are candid in your mission to support graduate workers, they have spoken and shown you the way, and they want a living wage. </p>
									
									<p>What is the living wage we are demanding? This was another question we asked graduate workers in our survey. We provided </p>

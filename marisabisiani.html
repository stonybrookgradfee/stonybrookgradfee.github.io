							<h3>Basic Info</h3>
							
							<p><strong>Salary:</strong> $222,800</p>
							
							<p>Marisa Bisiani is the Assistant Vice President for Student Health, Counseling and Prevention Services at Stony Brook University. Prior to joining SBU, Marisa served as the director of Infection Prevention and Occupational Health Services at John T. Mather Memorial Hospital.
</p>
							
							<p>Since her arrival, campus Recreation and Wellness has unsustainably expanded health-related initiatives, such as employing a dietician to do walk-in appointments at the Recreation Center, and pop-up health screening booths around campus. </p>
							
							<p>More recently, Bisiani has argued in meetings with Graduate students that increases in fees are necessary for her department to continue to expand programs, such as psychological services, and suicide prevention. According to Bisiani, increases to the Health Services Fee for FY 20/21 were proposed based on the increased demand for counselors. However, Bisiani has failed to provide data supporting her claim that these services are indeed benefitting graduate students. Furthermore, in her reports of costs of operations, and the expenditures for the proposed fee increases to the Graduate Student Organization, Bisiani failed to include external funding to her department, such as a $300,000 grant received by SBU for Suicide Prevention

							<h3>Quotes</h3>
							
							In the aforementioned meeting, Bisiani engaged in gaslighting graduate students by claiming that:
							
							<blockquote>The fact that you're able to walk on our campus and not get a communicable disease. [...] Do you know how many suicides we have averted? Our behavioral health team, our care team, we have a threat assessment team. Who do you think prevents active shooters coming in on campus? That's my team, guys. What are we talking about here? This is the safety of your campus. Let's argue about a fee of some other magnitude, but health? This to me is almost silly.
							</blockquote>
							
							Bisiani went even further, and compared our "obligation" to pay fees to taxes. However, this fallacious analogy does not address the fact that not every member of the SBU community pays fees, just students, and that Graduate students are deducted taxes on our already low stipends in addition to fees.

							<blockquote>
							 I'm just going to note something. Do any of you pay state or local taxes? [...] Do you pay over twenty thousand dollars a year [in taxes]? Look, when you do that, you come back and talk to me.
							</blockquote>
